# BBBResearch
Using FCNNs and quadratic polynomial regression to predict permeability of compounds through the Blood-Brain Barrier
The full feature dataset (509 molecules) as well as the actual dataset (281 molecukes) that was fed in for training/testing are both located in the repository. The feature search yielded many "not found" values-- molecules with more than 50% of data incomplete were removed from the dataset.
The code is written entirely in Python.
